## Overview

Create an automatic dashboard to help track the performance of a trader's behavior in the Forex market.

Help the owner manage discipline, and save time in performance tracking.

Offer a brief overview of key metrics in the trading market at first glance.

## Tools used for this project:

Power BI, Microsoft Excel

## Behavioral Analytics:

Tracking and analysis of historical trading patterns and behaviors.

Graphical representation of performance trends over time.

Identification of key performance metrics:

-   `Win/loss ratios`

-   `Average trade duration`

-   `Risk/reward ratios`

-   `Total orders`

-   `Net profit (profitability)`

-   `Overall win rate, win rate by month, win rate by currency,...`

These are key important numbers needed to perform calculation to help traders understand their performance in the market.

## Comparative analysis:

Comparative analysis against benchmark indices or other traders. Benchmarking against predefined trading goals and targets.

## Data collection

There are many ways to connect to data sources:

-   `Flat files: CSV, Txt files,...`

-   `Database`

-   `API gateway,`

-   `Web crawling,..`

Depending on the requirement, I would use a suitable tool to handle the problem.

The requirement of this case is to extract data from a flat file. Because, the platform provider offered a complete data set of the trader when doing transactions.

## Data visualization by Power BI platform

The dashboard shows the comprehensive overview of past performance data from a trader.

It provides crucial metrics empowering the trader with essential information for decision-making, and discipline management. These metrics are included such as `Total orders`, `Winrate by currency`,...

Among various charts featured this dashboard, two are particularly important to consider.

The first one is `Winrate by month`, illustrating stability of win rate over time when a trader implements his trading strategy in the market. In this case, the trader performs exceptionally and consistently.

The second one is `Most currency traded over time`. It shows the most and the least popular a traded currency was, and each of which has the Win/Loss result inside. This information assists the trader in identifying the currency unsuitable for his strategy, thereby improving the overall trading performance.
